NetPractice:
This project has been created as part
of the 42 curriculum by <elerazo->

Description:
Fundamental concepts of computer networks, such as TCP/IP, IP addressing, subnet masks, and routing.
The goal of this project is to learn how networks work by configuring different network scenarios level by level. 
Through practical exercises, you discover how machines communicate, how IP addressing works, and how data travels across networks.
This project is entirely practical and helps build intuition about networking concepts that are essential for any programmer.

Instructions:

#Running the training interface

1. Open the NetPractice interface provided by 42 (usually through the intranet).
2. Launch the project in your browser.
3. Each level presents a network diagram that must be correctly configured.
4. Fill in the required fields (IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, etc.).
5. Validate the level once the configuration is correct.

#Exporting configurations

1. After successfully completing a level, export the configuration using the export option provided by the interface.
2. Each level generates one configuration file.

#Submission requirements

1. You must export 10 configuration files, one per level.
2. All 10 exported files must be placed at the root of the Git repository.
3. No folders are required; the files must be directly in the repository root.

#Networking concepts studied
This project covers the following networking concepts:

1. TCP/IP addressing
2. IP addresses (IPv4)
3. Subnet masks
4. Default gateway
5. Routers and switches
6. OSI layers
7. Network communication between hosts

#References

1. 42 NetPractice subject documentation
2. Basic networking tutorials
3. Peer to per.

<Use of AI>
AI was used as a learning support tool to:
1. Clarify networking concepts in simple terms
2. Help structure explanations and documentation
3. Assist in understanding mistakes during level configurations
4. AI was not used to solve levels automatically, but as guidance to better
understand the theory behind the configurations.

#This project is part of the learning path at 42 and aims to build a solid foundation in networking through hands-on practice.i#
